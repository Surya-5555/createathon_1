<img src="C:\Users\angai\Downloads\stunguns.jpg" alt="PEPPER SPRAY" width="500" height="300">
<p>

The product is BIG and requires good arm and wrist strength to handle it, effectively, so please DON’T BUY IT, if YOU DON’T WANT an EXTRA LARGE stun gun.
Operates on two, replaceable, alkaline 9 volt batteries. We say NO to cheap rechargeable batteries with high failure rates.<br>  NOTE: The Stun Gun is NOT Rechargeable. Please use NEW Duracell 9 volt batteries, when you replace the batteries.<br>
On/Off safety switch and spring loaded activation trigger. The product activates when you turn the power ON and electrifies when you press the activation switch and stops when you release it. <br> NOTE: Remember to turn the power switch OFF when the product is not in use, otherwise the batteries will drain.
Visible electric arcing alternates up and down the side of the product. <br> NOTE: The visible electric arcing will tend to dominate one side of the product. This does not mean the other side is not electrified, the visible electric arcs to not be evenly distributed.<br>
<br>The electric arcing can look faster than in reality. This is an optical illusion. Please do not expect the product to be exactly the same as you see in the product demonstration or customer videos.<br>
Stun guns deliver a strong electric shock to an attacker, temporarily immobilizing them. These gadgets are effective but require close contact with the assailant.
<br>
Voltage: Higher voltage provides a stronger shock.Legality: Ensure stun guns are legal in your area before purchase.
Stun guns offer a high level of protection but should be used with caution and awareness of your surroundings.
